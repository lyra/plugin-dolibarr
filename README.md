# Lyra Collect for Dolibarr

Lyra Collect for Dolibarr is an open source plugin that links e-commerce websites based on Dolibarr to Lyra Collect secure payment gateway developed by [Lyra Network](https://www.lyra.com/).

## Installation & Upgarde

If a previous version of the Lyra Collect module is installed on your shop, you must uninstall it before adding. Connect to your FTP server and delete the plugin files and directories.

**Do not forget to backup your module settings.**

To install the new module version, unzip downloaded archive and copy the folder contents to your Dolibarr installation folder in `dolibarr/htdocs`.

## Configure newpayment.php
**Skip this configuration for version 13.0 or higher of Dolibarr.**

The file  __newpayment.php__  found in folder __temp_to_replace__, contains the calls to the hooks necessary to make payments with Lyra.

The following code should be replaced in  __newpayment.php__  file located in `dolibarr/htdocs/public/payment`

> Check if it is possible replace full newpayment.php file.

```
// Hook added by Lyra.
include_once DOL_DOCUMENT_ROOT . '/core/class/hookmanager.class.php';
$hookmanager = new HookManager($db);
$hookmanager->initHooks(array('newpayment'));
```

```
// This hook is used to push to $validpaymentmethod the Lyra payment method as valid.
$parameters = ['paymentmethod' => $paymentmethod, 'validpaymentmethod' => &$validpaymentmethod];
$reshook = $hookmanager->executeHooks('doValidatePayment', $parameters, $object, $action);
```

```
// Check status of the object (Invoice) to verify if it is paid.
$parameters = ['source' => $source, 'object' => $object];
$reshook = $hookmanager->executeHooks('doCheckStatus', $parameters, $object, $action);
```

```
// This hook is used to add Lyra button to newpayment.php.
$parameters = ['paymentmethod' => $paymentmethod];
$reshook = $hookmanager->executeHooks('doAddButton', $parameters, $object, $action);
```

```
// This hook is used to show the embedded form to make payments.
$parameters = [
			'paymentmethod'  => $paymentmethod,
			'amount'         => price2num(GETPOST("newamount"), 'MT'),
			'tag'            => GETPOST("tag", 'alpha'),
			'dopayment_lyra' => GETPOST('dopayment_lyra', 'alpha')
		];
